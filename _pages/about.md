About me
======

I completed my Ph.D. in Industrial and Systems Engineering at Virginia Tech advised by [Dr. Xiaowei Yue](https://www.ise.vt.edu/people/faculty/yue.html) and [Dr. Inyoung Kim](https://www.stat.vt.edu/people/stat-faculty/kim-inyoung.html) as part of the Machine Learning for Advanced Manufacturing Laboratory. 

My research interests include statistical quality control and machine learning, nonparametric regression and Gaussian processes, Bayesian modeling, and sequential design.

<!-- My research interests include cluster management systems, serverless computing, containerization, cloud computing, machine learning, distributed file and storage systems, and performance analysis. -->

<!-- You can find my CV [here](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~hadeel89/hadeelcv.pdf).  -->
